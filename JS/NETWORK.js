// Networking by node and node operation
// We can simulate the network by simply launching miltiple instances of the Electron application
// The applications should be able to locate some local server and from this local server communicate
// with the other instances.

// We then can simulate transaction creation by submitting packets between instances that represent some
// data transfers on a consistant interval. These packet transfers should generate transaction, that are
// later recorded to the bins of each of the instance memories.
